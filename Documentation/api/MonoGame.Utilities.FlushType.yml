    Closes the current block, but doesn&apos;t flush it to

    the output. Used internally only in hypothetical

    scenarios.  This was supposed to be removed by Zlib, but it is

    still in use in some edge cases.

  summary: "\nUse this during compression to specify that all pending output should be\nflushed to the output buffer and the output should be aligned on a byte\nboundary.
